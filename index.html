							<p>My name is Amit Ranganathan and I am currently an incoming junior at San Jose State University in the Bay Area.  I am a computer science major and absolutely love what I do.  I realized I wanted to pursue computer science in the summer before my junior year of high school when I took a C++ class.  I fell in love with the logic behind programming and knew then itself that CS is what I wanted to pursue.</p>

						<h3>Whiteboard GUI - JAVA</h3>
						<p style="color:white;">Created a whiteboard user interface using the Java swing interface, along with Java AWT.  Features include being able to draw certain shapes, resizing them, changing their colors, and other various features.  Another feature is save/open, where I use serialization to write out an XML file of the current whiteboard instance, which can then be opened to display that instance.  Finally, I used networking to create a client and server connection. </p>
